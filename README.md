# Photo Editor

This repository contains a simplified photo editing framework demonstrating how
a larger application could be structured. The focus is on showing the various
modules and their interactions rather than providing a complete replacement for
professional tools like Photoshop or Lightroom.

## Features

- Load a folder of images as a catalog
- Combine multiple catalogs
- Apply basic edits such as brightness, denoise and HSL adjustments
- Overlay images and apply regional masks
- Save and load presets
- AI assistant that can suggest hashtags, propose edit settings and ask
  questions about style
- Insert basic metadata generated by the assistant
- Share to several social media platforms
- Sleek GUI for interactive editing

## Usage

```
python -m photo_editor.cli <catalog_path> --brightness 1.2 --denoise
```

You can pass multiple folders to combine catalogs and optional arguments such as
`--overlay` to blend another image, `--mask` to brighten a region, and
`--share` to output directly to social platforms:

```
python -m photo_editor.cli folder1 folder2 --overlay logo.png --share instagram,twitter
```

Use the `--auto-suggest` flag to automatically apply edit suggestions from the
AI assistant. Add `--ask` to display stylistic questions before processing:

```
python -m photo_editor.cli folder --auto-suggest --ask
```

### Graphical interface

You can also launch a simple GUI to manually preview and edit images:

```
python -m photo_editor.gui
```

Presets are stored in a `presets` folder inside the catalog directory as JSON
files. Each preset can hold arbitrary settings, for example:

```
{"brightness": 1.1}
```

The project is intentionally lightweight and provides placeholders for more
advanced functionality (masking, generative AI, culling, etc.) that could be
implemented in the future.
